Hello world! This is my first blog using GitHub Pages.

I worked on this website for almost a day and found out GitHub Pages is very easy to write code. Originally, I was going for a written test from Tencent at 4 a.m. (7 p.m. in Beijing), but I found there actually isn't any. Nevertheless, I stayed up late until now, like 3:44 a.m., to finish writing this awesome website.

Speaking of the written test from Tencent, the summer internships are not looking good for me. I applied a dozen and got interviewed a few. However, I feel like I am in the the middle of a good coder and a good statistian, while all the internships need me both. Knowledge is hard to keep in my head and my notes are scattered everywhere. Sometimes I get headache when I think about them. Anyway, I hope this spring recruitment thing turns out to be a good experience for me to prepare for the next internship.

Things didn't go very well these days, but I hope everything will be ok in the future.
