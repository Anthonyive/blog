## A little bio

I'm Yuchen Zhang, also as known as Anthony Zhang. I came to the United States for study since 2016. Ever since I studies abroad, he is ambitious, persistent, and filled with passion. At the time of I writing this, I have been to the U.S. for five years, and during these years, I have been got involved in tons of opportunities and supports. I also have seen and learned a lot of things than I could ever imagine, so I think it's a great idea to write things I have learned and have seen.

I'm broadly interested in natural language processing, image processing, knowledge graphs and general machine learning research. I began my research by predicting FIFA players wages in my undergraduate. My current research is focused on finding uncanny valleys of story creepiness. Across all my research experiences, they all lie in developing statistical or machine learning models to solve varies tasks. As a continuation of my career, I see myself using my strong statistical background and advance programming skills to develop statistical methods or machine learning methods to tackle the important scientific questions in Data Science. So, I hope this website can help me apply to internships that give me real-life experiences on data science, which is the major I am currently in, or meeting with great researchers.
